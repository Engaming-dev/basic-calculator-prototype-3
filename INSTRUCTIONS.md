# INSTRUCTIONS
(read carefully before using the program.)
In this .md file, i will explain how the program should be used.
## How to use
Once the version number pops up after clicking "Run",
you should be asked to enter the numbers of your choosing.
### Notice
If a "number" like this is typed in (12y34u8), the code will only consider the first numbers (the numbers before the first letter).Also currently, if you dont need a number to be typed (e.g. you only need the numbers a and b to be numbers 1-2 not 1-2-3-4) press enter on the last two numbers. Notice complete.
after this, the program will run the calculation and return with the results. if you need the added results, look at FINAL RESULT or FINAL RESULT (ONLY A AND B ADDED TOGETHER).
This should give you the fundamentals to the program.

# basic-calculator-prototype-3
welcome to my project. im trying to create a simple calculator. i would appreciate if you would help. you are going to need a piece of software that can run ruby files the use the program.
i will soon release other ways to access the program,but this is the current way to do it.
## what have i created
NOTE:This was written at the time prototype 5 was the latest version.
Currently, i have created possibilities for 4 number addition, 4 number multiplication and 2 number division. i will make the code more complex as time goes on,but currently(with prototype 5)
the code is really simple.
